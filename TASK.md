## Hooks (Pre-Implementation) — RUN THESE FIRST

> **IMPORTANT:** You MUST run all pre-implementation hooks below BEFORE writing any code or making any changes. Do not skip this step.

### Pipeline Checks
Run the `run_hooks` MCP tool to execute all configured checks in parallel.


## Hooks (Post-Implementation)

After completing your work, run these hook steps:

### Pipeline Checks
Run the `run_hooks` MCP tool to execute all configured checks in parallel.

### summarize-changes
Call `report_hook_status` (without success/summary) to mark it running, invoke the `/summarize-changes` skill, then call `report_hook_status` again with the result.

### review-changes
Call `report_hook_status` (without success/summary) to mark it running, invoke the `/review-changes` skill, then call `report_hook_status` again with the result.

### how-to-test
Call `report_hook_status` (without success/summary) to mark it running, invoke the `/how-to-test` skill, then call `report_hook_status` again with the result.

### write-tests
Call `report_hook_status` (without success/summary) to mark it running, invoke the `/write-tests` skill, then call `report_hook_status` again with the result.

### explain-like-im-5
Call `report_hook_status` (without success/summary) to mark it running, invoke the `/explain-like-im-5` skill, then call `report_hook_status` again with the result.

## Hooks (Custom — Condition-Based)

> These hooks have natural-language conditions. Evaluate each condition against the current task and run the hook only when the condition applies.

### echo "ANALYZED"
**When:** run this hook after you grasp what you need to do for this task. output what you understood needs to be done
Run `echo "ANALYZED"` in the worktree directory.
